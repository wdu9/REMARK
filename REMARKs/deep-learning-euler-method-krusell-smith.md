  We introduce a unified deep learning method that solves
  dynamic economic models by casting them into nonlinear
  regression equations. We derive such equations for three
  fundamental objects of economic dynamics â€“ lifetime reward
  functions, Bellman equations and Euler equations. We
  estimate the decision functions on simulated data using a
  stochastic gradient descent method. We introduce an
  all-in-one integration operator that facilitates
  approximation of high-dimensional integrals. We use neural
  networks to perform model reduction and to handle
  multicollinearity. Our deep learning method is tractable
  in large-scale problems, e.g., Krusell and Smith (1998).
  We provide a TensorFlow code that accommodates a variety
  of applications.

# Deep learning for solving dynamic economic models

This notebook solves a version of Krusell and Smith's (1998) heterogenous-agent model with idiosyncrastic and aggregate shocks, incomplete markets and borrowing constraints. It uses a deep learning Euler-equation method introduced by Maliar, Maliar and Winant (2018) in the paper "Deep learning for solving dynamic economic models", Journal of Monetary Economics 122, pp 76-101. https://lmaliar.ws.gc.cuny.edu/files/2021/09/JME2021.pdf

We show a version of the Euler equation method that minimizes the sum of squared residuals in the equilibrium conditions. See [https://deepecon.org](https://deepecon.org) for documentation, updates and the other versions of the deep learning method (Bellman equation and life-time reward).
